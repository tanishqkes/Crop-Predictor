# AgroSense
AgroSense is an intelligent crop recommendation system that uses Machine Learning to analyze environmental and soil parameters. It provides farmers with data-driven insights to select the most suitable crops for optimal yield and economic stabilit.

**Project Overview: AgroSense** <br>
**Tagline: Smart Farming for Better Yields**

Agriculture and related sectors contribute approximately 15 percent to India's Gross Value Added (GVA). Poorly informed decisions by farmers can significantly impact the economy of an entire region. To address this, we have developed AgroSense, an intelligent crop recommendation system. AgroSense aims to provide Indian farmers with predictive insights, enabling them to make more informed decisions about which crops to produce.

Typically, a farmer's decision on crop cultivation is influenced by intuition and other irrelevant factors, such as seeking quick profits, ignoring market demand, or overestimating soil potential. Such unwise decisions can severely strain a farmer's financial status, potentially leading to debtâ€”a significant factor in the high number of farmer suicides.

**AgroSense: Leveraging Machine Learning for Smart Farming**

AgroSense utilizes Machine Learning to predict crop suitability by analyzing relevant data such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, soil pH, and rainfall. By considering these parameters, AgroSense recommends the most suitable crops for better yield in a given region.

**Machine Learning Algorithms and Accuracy**

To enhance the accuracy of our predictions, we employed and compared various Machine Learning algorithms:

**Decision Tree: 90.68%** <br>
**Naive Bayes: 98.86%** <br>
**Support Vector Machine (SVM): 97.72%** <br>
**Random Forest (RF): 99.54%** <br>
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 96.82%** <br>

Among these, the **Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy at 99.54%**, making it the preferred choice for our final model.

**Enhancements and Future Work**

To further enhance the accuracy and utility of AgroSense, several additional steps could be considered:

**Feature Engineering:** Incorporate more features such as soil texture, pest incidence, crop rotation history, and market prices to improve prediction accuracy.<br>
**Ensemble Methods:** Combine predictions from multiple algorithms using ensemble techniques like boosting or stacking to enhance overall model performance.<br>
**Geospatial Data:** Integrate GIS data to provide more localized and precise crop recommendations.<br>
**User Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback mechanism where farmers can report back on the actual yields obtained, allowing the model to learn and improve over time.<br>
**Seasonal and Long-term Trends:** Factor in historical weather patterns and long-term climate trends to make more robust predictions.<br>
**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Continuously refine the hyperparameters of the model to keep up with new data and changing conditions.<br>

**Conclusion**<br>
AgroSense is designed to fulfill the primary role of an AgroConsultant, offering farmers precise crop recommendations. By providing data-driven insights, AgroSense helps farmers optimize their crop selection, enhance productivity, and achieve better economic stability. This intelligent crop recommendation system aims to empower farmers with the tools they need for smart farming, ultimately contributing to the well-being of their families and the overall economy.

**Thank You**<br>
We welcome contributions to this model to further enhance its accuracy and effectiveness. Your insights and feedback are valuable in making AgroSense a reliable tool for farmers across India. Thank you for supporting smart farming for better yields!
